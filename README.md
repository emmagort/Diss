This joint honors dissertation is a two-part research paper. The first half aims to answer two key
 questions: "Are students willing to embrace code comprehension questions as a self-study tool?"
 and "Is Moodle the appropriate vehicle to allow for the seamless integration of these into the
 course?" motivated by the prevalence of code comprehension in computing science education
 research paired with the impact of the AI revolution. These two questions are answered through
 an exploratory study that used the University of Glasgowâ€™s 1CT "Introduction to Computational
 Thinking" course as a test case. The evaluation of this process leads to the realization that
 students are in fact happy to embrace this new tool, but that unfortunately, Moodle presents
 some shortcomings when it comes to the style of questions that can be created using it.
 This leads to the second half of the project, the development of the prototype of a web application.
 This web app is designed to address some of the shortcomings encountered when working with
 Moodle; allowing for some of the more interactive question styles that had not been implementable
 with Moodle, such as the ability to draw boxes around lines of code.
 An evaluation of this tool shows that both students and tutors/demonstrators are receptive to the
 prototype created and that hence it may be worth developing further in the future with the goal
 of incorporating it into Moodle and other virtual learning environments.
